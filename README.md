## The Functionalities:
<hr>
- The E-commerce App project is a react project that has a lot of functions and I fixed a lot of problems that I faced while developing it. <br>
- One of the problems that I faced was in payment stage that when the payment is done the cart still has the items so i made a function the empty the cart after payment. <br>
- Another problem i faced in the last payment step was that it takes a lot of time and nothing happens so i put a loader there. <br>
